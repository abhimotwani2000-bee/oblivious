            <h2>Chapter 1: How is that possible!</h2>
            <p>The sun was setting over Greenhill, splashing the sky with pink and gold. John leaned against the rickety porch railing of the town’s tavern, staring at the palace on the hill. Its tall towers glowed like something from a storybook, grand and full of secrets. He sipped his lemonade, thinking about a day long ago when he’d visited that very palace. Back then, the palace had been buzzing with music and laughter. A boy named Mike had been there, standing next to his dad, Ross, who looked like he could run the whole world. Mike had a smile that made everyone feel happy, and his eyes sparkled with mischief. “Hey there,” John had said, bending down to talk to Mike. “What’s your name?” “Mike,” the boy answered, grinning wide. “How old are you, Mike?” John asked. “Twenty years younger than my dad,” Mike said with a giggle, making John laugh. “You’re a clever one,” John said, giving Mike a friendly pat on the shoulder. “Just like your dad!”</p>
            <p>That memory was one of John’s favorites— Mike’s big smile, the fun party, and the feeling that everything was perfect. He never imagined Mike would become part of a mystery. “John, you okay?” Jake’s voice pulled him back to the present. Jake was sprawled in a chair across the porch, his boots propped on a crate. He was a young man with messy hair and a grin that said he was always ready for an adventure. John smiled. “Just thinking about Mike. He was a funny kid with a great smile. I never thought he’d disappear.” Jake sat up, surprised. “Disappear? What happened to him?” “You didn’t hear?” John said, his voice quiet. “Mike went missing a year ago. No one’s seen him since.” Jake’s eyes widened. “That’s terrible! How did he go missing?” John glanced at the palace, its windows twinkling like stars. “It happened on his eighteenth birthday, at a huge party in the palace.”</p>
            <p>“You mean that giant house on the hill?” Jake asked, leaning forward. “Yup,” John said. “That’s where Mike’s dad, Ross, lives. He’s a big-deal businessman, so he has a palace, not a regular house like us.” Jake crossed his arms. “Well, if I didn’t have my family keeping me here, I’d leave Greenhill and live somewhere exciting!” John chuckled. “Oh yeah? Where would you go?” “A big city!” Jake said, his eyes shining. “Or that palace. It looks amazing!” “You wouldn’t last one day in a city,” John teased. “And that palace? It’s not as safe as it seems.” Jake made a face. “What do you mean? It’s just a fancy house!” “Haven’t you heard the stories?” John said, lowering his voice like he was sharing a secret. “Weird things happen at that palace.” Jake rolled his eyes. “You mean those silly tales about the Greenhill Palace? They’re just made-up stories!” John frowned. “What about the people who got lost in the forest behind the palace? Like Mike?” Jake shrugged. “I don’t believe in mysteries unless I see them myself.” “Then you should’ve been at Mike’s birthday party,” John said mysteriously. Jake’s curiosity sparked. “I was out of town that day, or I’d have been there! What happened at the party?” John shook his head. “It was a year ago. Let’s not talk about it.” “Oh, come on!” Jake begged, grinning. “Tell me about the Greenhill Palace mysteries!” John sighed. “You wouldn’t believe me anyway.” “I would if you took me there!” Jake said, his eyes twinkling with excitement. John shook his head. “No way. Ross would be so mad if I brought you to his palace.” “But you’re his best friend!” Jake said. “And they’re away for a whole week!” “I’m not taking you,” John said firmly. “That palace has super valuable paintings and stuff. You’d probably touch everything!” “Hey!” Jake said, pretending to be offended. “I’m practically a detective. I’d be careful!”</p>
            <p>John laughed. “A detective? Like that goofy TV show you watch?” “I solved that argument between Jess and that guy last month,” Jake said proudly. “That doesn’t make you a detective,” John said, still smiling. Jake threw his hands up. “Okay, fine! But please, just take me to the palace!” John looked at Jake’s eager face and sighed. “Alright, alright. We’ll go at five tonight. The butler leaves then, so the palace will be empty.” Jake cheered. “Yes! I promise I won’t touch anything without asking!” “You better not,” John said. “Meet me at the Golden Circle, and don’t be late.” The hill to the palace was steep, and Jake’s boots kicked up dust as he climbed. The sun was almost gone, and the sky was turning purple. John was supposed to meet him at the Golden Circle, but he hadn’t shown up. Jake was too excited to wait, so he decided to go to the palace alone. When he reached the top, he stopped and stared.</p>
            <p>The palace was even cooler up close, with huge doors and vines climbing the walls like green ribbons. Behind it, a forest stretched out, its trees swaying in the breeze. The palace looked like it belonged in an adventure book. “Wow,” Jake said, grinning. “This place isn’t spooky at all!” Inside, the palace was like a dream. A giant room with shiny floors and sparkling chandeliers greeted him. A big staircase curled up to the next floor, and pictures of fancy people and pretty places hung on the walls. Jake walked slowly, his eyes wide, feeling like an explorer in a new world. He wandered into a bedroom and saw a photo on the wall. It was Mike, smiling his big, happy smile, standing next to Ross in front of the palace. Jake’s heart felt a little heavy. Where are you, Mike? A window caught his attention, showing the forest outside, now dark and mysterious. He was about to turn away when he saw something move—a shadowy figure climbing up the palace wall! Jake’s heart raced, but he was more curious than scared.</p>
            <p>He hid in a closet, peeking out as the figure slipped through the window and landed in the room. The person wore a mask and carried a black bag. “The butler’s gone,” he whispered, then hurried out of the room. Jake’s mind buzzed. Who is that? How does he know when the butler leaves? He decided to follow, tiptoeing quietly. The masked person was looking for something, checking shelves and peeking behind pictures. He moved through the palace like he knew every corner, which made Jake super curious. Jake kept following, staying sneaky. When the person went into the kitchen, Jake thought he might be getting a snack. But then the figure stopped and took off the mask. Jake’s jaw dropped. He couldn’t believe his eyes. No way! It’s Mike!</p>

            <h2>Chapter 2: εκλείπω</h2>
            <p>Mike stood in the palace kitchen when a familiar voice made him jump. “Mike! What are you doing here?” It was his mom, Kate, standing in the doorway with a worried frown. “Your dad’s been looking everywhere for you!” Mike’s eyes went wide. “Mom! How did you find me? I was hiding so Dad wouldn’t drag me to his factory. It’s super boring there!” Kate sighed, putting her hands on her hips. “Oh, Mike, when are you going to try new things? School’s out for the holidays, and you’ve got nothing else to do. Why not go with your dad and see what his business is all about?” Mike kicked at the floor. “I know Dad’s got a big company, but I’m not interested in all that stuff.” “I’m not saying you have to run the business,” Kate said gently. “You’re only 17. Just spend a day with him. It’ll make him happy.” Mike crossed his arms. “Yeah, well, why can’t I do things other 17-year-olds do, like hang out with my friends?”</p>
            <p>“I’m not stopping you,” Kate said. “Your dad built this business for you, though. Just for today, go with him and make him smile.” Mike sighed. “Okay, fine. I’ll go with Dad today. But tomorrow, I’m with my friends.” Kate smiled. “Deal. Now go tell him.” Mike ran to the grand hall, where his dad, Ross, was sorting papers. The hall sparkled with chandeliers, like a room from a fairy tale. “Hey, Dad,” Mike said, “I’m coming with you to the factory.” Ross looked up, surprised. “What changed your mind?” Mike grinned. “Just being a good son, that’s all.” Ross chuckled. “I bet my good son wants something. Like that new bike we talked about?” Mike laughed. “Maybe! Can’t I just make you happy?” “Deal,” Ross said, ruffling Mike’s hair. “Let’s go.” They laughed and headed to the factory, a huge building full of clanking machines and busy workers.</p>
            <p>Mike sat in Ross’s office for a bit, watching his dad talk on the phone and run meetings. It was kind of dull, but Mike liked seeing his dad in charge. Then Ross had to leave for a big meeting. “Stay here, Mike,” he said. “I’ll be back soon.” The moment Ross left, Mike jumped up. “Time to explore!” he said to himself. He wandered through the factory, amazed by the giant machines that whirred and buzzed, making all sorts of things. Conveyor belts and shiny tools were everywhere—it was like a giant toy workshop! After a while, Mike spotted a door with a big red sign that said, “DO NOT ENTER.” His eyes lit up. “Ooh, a mystery!” Without a second thought, he pushed the door open and slipped inside. The room was dark and quiet, not like the busy factory. Mike’s heart raced with excitement, but something felt odd. He saw things that made him curious. What are these? he wondered. Why are they hidden? That night, Mike got home before his dad. He was quiet.</p>
            <p>His head full of questions about what he’d seen. He headed to his room, but his mom noticed he looked puzzled. “Mike?” Kate called, climbing the stairs to check on him. But when she opened his door, the room was empty. “That’s weird,” she muttered. “I just saw him come in. Where could he be?” Kate searched the palace, checking the library, the dining hall, and every corner. Mike was nowhere. Just then, Ross came home, looking tired and grumpy. Kate hurried downstairs. “Ross, Mike’s gone again! I saw him go to his room, but he’s not there!” Ross rubbed his face. “This day just keeps getting worse.” “What happened?” Kate asked, worried. “I lost something important at the factory today,” Ross said. “We looked all evening, but it’s gone. And now Mike’s missing?” “What did you lose?” Kate asked. “That’s not the biggest problem right now,” Ross said. “We need to find Mike.”</p>
            <p>“Why do you need to find me?” Mike’s voice came from the doorway. He stepped inside, looking a bit sheepish. “Mike!” Kate rushed over. “Where were you? I thought you went to your room!” Ross raised an eyebrow. “Vanished, huh?” “I didn’t vanish,” Mike said quickly. “You must’ve seen the butler or something.” Kate frowned. “Where were you, and why are you so late?” “It’s late,” Ross said, sounding tired. “Go to bed, Mike. We’ll talk tomorrow.” Mike trudged to his room, his face full of wonder and worry. That night, he lay in bed, unable to sleep. He kept thinking about the odd things in that forbidden room. What were they? Why were they hidden? I have to go back and find out. Maybe I can help somehow. Finally, Mike drifted off, dreaming of secret doors and factory mysteries. The next morning, Mike woke up super early, before his parents. He got dressed, grabbed his backpack, and raced to his best friend Marvin’s house in Greenhill. Marvin was a kind, clever kid who’d been Mike’s friend forever.</p>
            <p>He lived in a cozy house with his hard-working parents, and even though he didn’t have a fancy palace, he was always ready to help anyone. “Marvin!” Mike said, bursting through the door. “You won’t believe what I saw at my dad’s factory!” Marvin’s eyes lit up. “Tell me everything!” Mike told him about the forbidden room and the strange shapes. “I need to go back and figure it out. Will you come with me?” “Of course!” Marvin said. “Let’s solve this mystery!” They hurried to the factory, which was closed for the day. Mike pulled out a special card that opened the gates. As they stepped inside, the gates clanged shut behind them. “Is this safe?” Marvin asked, his voice a little nervous. “Don’t worry,” Mike said with a grin. “We’ll be in and out in no time, and no one will know!” Marvin looked around, amazed by the huge machines. “What does your dad even do here?”</p>
            <p>Mike shrugged. “He talks to business people on the phone a lot. That’s all I know.” “Hey!” Marvin pointed to a door with a red sign. “Is that the one you meant?” “Yup!” Mike said. “Come on, I’ll show you what I saw.” They pushed open the door and stepped inside. Mike’s jaw dropped. The room was empty.</p>

            <h2>Chapter 3: The Mystery!</h2>
            <p>Moonlight glowed over the factory yard in Greenhill, casting shadows on the dusty ground. A soft breeze rustled the tall grass as Ross stood by some crates, his flashlight flickering across the dirt. He was searching for something strange he’d seen earlier, the air sharp with the smell of oil. The factory’s brick walls loomed behind him, its machines humming faintly. His assistant, Philip, shuffled up, slouched and exhausted, his face grumpy under messy curls. “Are you sure you saw what you told me?” Philip asked, his voice worn out, rubbing his eyes. “Yes!” Ross said, gesturing excitedly. “I was on the factory’s rooftop an hour ago when I heard a loud CRASH. I ran down and saw two bodies lying on the ground—tall, like eight or nine feet, but not exactly human. They looked so different, I can’t explain it unless you see them!” Philip frowned. “But you heard a crash. Didn’t you see a vehicle or something?”</p>
            <p>“No,” Ross said, shaking his head. “That’s the weird part. There was smoke curling up, but no car or machine—just those bodies lying there.” “Okay, I’m super tired,” Philip said, crossing his arms. “We’ve looked forever and found nothing. Can we go? You’ve got Mike’s 17th birthday party at the palace.” Ross kept searching, like he’d lost something precious. Philip tilted his head. “Why are you so eager to find those things?” “They had special rings on their hands,” Ross said, his eyes shining. “Both had one, and they glowed like they had some power.” Philip’s eyes widened. “Glowing rings? That’s why you’re so excited?” “Yes!” Ross said. “They weren’t normal rings.” He sighed, disappointed. “Fine, let’s go to the party.” He planned to return later. Ross dropped Philip at the Golden Circle and drove to the palace. The palace rose like a castle from a storybook, its tall towers glowing under the starry sky. Vines curled around its grey stone walls, and warm golden light spilled from the windows.</p>
            <p>As Ross stepped through the massive oak doors, the chatter of guests filled the air. Friends and neighbors, dressed in bright party clothes, crowded the marble foyer, holding plates of frosted cupcakes and glasses of fizzy punch. A cheerful tune played from a band in the corner, and the smell of vanilla and chocolate wafted through the room. “Ross, why are you so late?” they called, their voices mingling with the music. Ross waved them off, his heart set on finding Mike. “Dad! Dad!” Mike’s voice rang out, bright and eager, from the spiral staircase. He bounded down, his sneakers squeaking on the polished steps, his grin as wide as the moon. His dark hair flopped over his eyes, and he wore a blue party hat tilted to one side, wobbling as he ran. “Where were you? We haven’t cut the cake yet, and everyone’s starving for chocolate!” Ross laughed, pulling Mike into a big hug, his jacket still dusty from the factory. “Sorry, buddy. I got stuck at the factory with some… weird business. But I’m here now, and I’m staying till this party’s done.”</p>
            <p>Mike grabbed his dad’s hand and tugged him toward the grand hall, a dazzling room with crystal chandeliers twinkling like a sky full of stars. A long table stood in the center, covered with a red velvet cloth and holding a giant chocolate cake, its icing swirled with colorful sprinkles and topped with 17 candles. A glittery banner above read, “Happy 17th Birthday, Mike!” Guests cheered as Mike and Ross stood by the cake, and Mike sliced the first piece, chocolate crumbs flying everywhere. Laughter and music filled the hall, with kids dancing and grown-ups clapping, but Ross’s thoughts kept drifting to the factory yard and those mysterious figures lying on the ground. When the party ended, and guests waved goodbye, Ross slipped away. He drove back to the factory under the moonlit sky, the road winding through Greenhill’s quiet hills, where fireflies blinked in the grass. The factory yard was silent now, the machines still. Ross searched every corner, his flashlight beam dancing over crates and patches of dirt. He felt a pang of disappointment.</p>
            <p>Just as he turned to leave, a deafening CRASH shook the ground. Ross’s heart leaped. He sprinted toward the sound, his boots kicking up dust, his breath puffing in the cool night air. In a clearing beyond the yard, flames flickered and smoke curled into the sky. There, half-hidden by tall, swaying grass, was a strange machine—rectangular, gleaming like polished silver, with blinking lights along its edges and a soft hum that tickled Ross’s ears. It looked like something from another planet. Beside it lay a figure, ten feet tall, its stone-like skin shimmering faintly in the firelight. On its finger was a glowing ring, pulsing with blue and green light, just like the ones Ross had seen on the figures before. Ross’s breath caught. “This is unbelievable,” he whispered, his eyes wide with wonder. This wasn’t a person—it was something from another world! He pulled out his phone and called Philip. “Get to the factory quick! Bring some workers. We need to move this machine and the figure inside.”</p>
            <p>Soon, Philip arrived with a few strong workers, their faces puzzled but curious under their caps. Together, they carefully hauled the machine and the tall figure into the factory’s main workshop. Ross explored the machine, running his hands over its smooth, cool surface. It had strange buttons that glowed softly, like tiny fireflies, and screens showing squiggly lines and symbols he couldn’t understand. He called some scientist friends to come check out the tall figure. Ross stayed up all night, his heart racing with excitement. The machine was amazing, with its blinking lights and mysterious hum, but the glowing ring on the figure’s hand was what he couldn’t stop staring at. He gently slid the ring off the figure’s finger. It felt warm, and its blue-green glow seemed to pulse like a heartbeat. “Philip, try it on,” Ross said, his voice brimming with curiosity, his eyes locked on the ring. Ross had tried the ring himself, but it wouldn’t fit his finger.</p>
            <p>Philip hesitated, his eyes nervous, his hands fidgeting with his jacket. “Are you sure this is safe?” he asked, but he took the ring and slipped it on. POOF! A flash of light swallowed him, bright as a lightning bolt, and he vanished! Ross gasped, stumbling back, his elbow bumping a table. A few seconds later, Philip reappeared, his face pale as the moon, his hands trembling like leaves in a storm. “What happened?” Ross asked, his voice urgent, stepping closer. “You disappeared! Where did you go? What did you see?” Philip’s eyes were huge, darting around the workshop. “I… I saw something weird,” he stammered, his voice shaky. “It was like… a different place, all glowy and strange. I can’t explain it.” Ross leaned closer, his heart pounding. “Are you okay?” Philip nodded, but he looked rattled, his hands still trembling. “I need to go home,” he said softly, his voice barely a whisper, as he slipped the ring off and set it on the table. Ross frowned but nodded. “Alright, get some rest.”</p>
            <p>Ross also left for home after a while, as he drove through Greenhill’s quiet streets. His head was full of mysteries—the machine, the tall figures lying on the ground, the glowing ring. But Philip’s scared face stuck with him most. Instead of driving home to the palace, Ross turned toward Philip’s house, a small cottage on the edge of Greenhill, surrounded by wildflowers and a picket fence. He had to know if Philip was okay and what he’d seen. When Ross pulled up, the front door was wide open, swinging gently in the night breeze, its hinges creaking softly. A chill ran down his spine. “That’s not right,” he muttered, his breath puffing in the cool air. He stepped out, his boots crunching on the gravel path, and he went straight up to Philip’s room, his heart pounding with curiosity and a flicker of worry. Ross opened the door of Philip’s room, but what he saw terrified him as Philip was lying on his bed with his eyes wide open and a knife in his stomach.</p>
